## Welcome to your IRC. (Internet Relay Chat)

### An IRC is used for instant communication mainly in the form of group discussions via discussion channels, it is a bit like "the ancestor" of MSN.
### To make these discussions possible, we need socket.io (the front is in react).
#### To access it, you just need to enter a nickname and you will be in contact with all the people on the reception channel.

#### You can then create your own conversations. A detailed list of options is available by clicking on the "?" Button.
